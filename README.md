Mango leaf  diseases dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/mango-leaf-disease-dataset

This is my attempt of implementing the image classifier of mango leaf disease dataset from kaggle using CNN and other Machine Learning models like Random Forest, KNN, Decision tree, Naive Bayes.
In this dataset there are total 8 types of diseases including healthy. I downloaded the dataset from kaggle and named the folder as 'leaf-diseases'.
